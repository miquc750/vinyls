                <h2>The Works</h2>
                <h3>Queen</h3>
                <p>Harry Styles releases his third album, titled 'Harry's house', which is preceded by the wonderful 'As it was'. Two and a half years have passed since the release of his previous studio work and, since then, Styles has participated in two shoots, has toured constantly -stopping tickets wherever he went- and has given him time to develop this new work, but above all, during this time the Briton has been catapulted to global stardom.</p>
                <p>Thanks to 'Fine line', the pop world definitively surrendered to one of the greatest talents of our days and the musician from Redditch made history, breaking the sales record for a British artist on Billboard in the first week and becoming the first UK male artist to enter directly at #1 on Billboard with two consecutive albums.</p>
